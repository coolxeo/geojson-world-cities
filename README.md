## About the dataset

* The data is sourced from [http://www.vdstech.com/world-data.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20180423190124/http://www.vdstech.com/world-data.aspx) and converted with http://ogre.adc4gis.com/.
* There are 37,372 cities with defined Polygon boundaries with the precision of 5 decimal points (about 1 meter),
although accuracy of the data (how well the polygons define the real-world city boundaries) varies greately.
* Each polygon is only identifiable by city `NAME`, from no particular standard.
There are many cities with the same name.
(eg there are 11 `SPRINGFIELD`s and 2 `MOSCOW`s), either due to duplication or because
they are located in different counties/states.
* Cities with `NAME = null` were removed by [@ilyankou](https://github.com/ilyankou).
